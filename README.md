## Deepfake detection resnet inceptionnet

The dataset used for training the data is [openForensics](https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/openforensics).

### About the OpenForensics data set
<p>1. It is the most challenging datset till date.<br>
2.This dataset contains images that were produced by GAN. By swapping two persons identity.(face identity)<br> 
3.This dataset supports both deepfake and general face related tasks because of rich annotations.<br>
4.Human Performance in Face forgery Detection is least in this dataset when compared with other avaialbe datsets like <strong>DFDC</strong> and <strong>FaceForensics++*</strong>.<br>
5.Human Performance in Multiface forgery detection descents sharply even if one face identity in the image out of the many is fake.<br>


<br><br></p>

### Literature Review in brief
<p>1. In previous dataset only one face indentity was present in a singular image. <br>
 2. In this datset more than one face identity is present in the Singular image. Therefore, making it difficult to detect deepfakes.<br>
 3. <strong>No previous work have been done before on this dataset.<br>
 4. Deep learning techniques perform better than any other technique present. One reason is, as now deepfakes a created by deep learning techniques to bring them to perfection.<br>
 5. CNN performs better on image classification.

 ### Force*displacement
  
 <p>1. I have been training different CNN models and analyzing the results continuously.<br> 
  2.The names of the files are like DF.*(ascending order with time.)<br>
