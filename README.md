## Deepfake detection resnet inceptionnet

The dataset used for training the data is [openForensics](https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/openforensics)

### About the data set
<p>1. It is the most challenging datset till date.
1.This dataset contains images that were produced by GAN. By swapping two persons identity.(face identity)<br> 
2.This dataset supports both deepfake and general face related tasks because of rich annotations.<br>
3.Human Performance in Face forgery Detection is least in this dataset when compared with other avaialbe datsets like <strong>DFDC</strong> and <strong>FaceForensics++*</strong>.<br>
4.Human Performance in Multiface forgery detection descents sharply even if one face identity in the image out of the many is fake.<br></p>



I have been training different models and updating continuously the names are like DF.*
