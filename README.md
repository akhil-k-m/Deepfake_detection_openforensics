## Deepfake detection resnet inceptionnet

The dataset used for training the data is openForensics and DFDC provided by META

###About the data set
1.This dataset contains images that were produced by GAN. By swapping two persons identity.(face identity) 
2.This dataset supports both deepfake and general face related tasks because of rich annotations.
3.Human Performance in Face forgery Detection is least in this dataset when compared with other avaialbe datsets like **DFDC** and **FaceForensics++**.
4.Human Performance in Multiface forgery detection descents sharply even if one face identity in the image out of the many is fake.


I have been training different models and updating continuously the names are like DF.*
