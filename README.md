## Deepfake detection resnet inceptionnet

The dataset used for training the data is openForensics and DFDC provided by META

### About the data set
<p>1.This dataset contains images that were produced by GAN. By swapping two persons identity.(face identity)<br> 
2.This dataset supports both deepfake and general face related tasks because of rich annotations.<br>
3.Human Performance in Face forgery Detection is least in this dataset when compared with other avaialbe datsets like * DFDC * and *FaceForensics++*.<br>
4.Human Performance in Multiface forgery detection descents sharply even if one face identity in the image out of the many is fake.<br></p>


I have been training different models and updating continuously the names are like DF.*
